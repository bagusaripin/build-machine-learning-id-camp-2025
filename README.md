# build-machine-learning-id-camp-2025
In this project, I had to process the 𝐛𝐚𝐧𝐤_𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧_𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚.𝐜𝐬𝐯 dataset using two models: clustering and classification.
The dataset was analyzed using K-Means clustering (Elbow Method, PCA, Silhouette Score), then classified using Decision Tree and KNN, evaluated with a confusion matrix.
